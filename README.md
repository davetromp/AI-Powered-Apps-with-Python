# Generative AI-Powered Apps with Python
A collection of applications written in python that use Generative AI to do useful things. Hopefully.

I have developed these apps as a prove of concept as part of the following IBM course at Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-gen-ai-powered-applications/

## Module 1: Image Captioning with Generative AI
