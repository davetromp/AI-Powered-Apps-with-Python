# Personal assistant
Please create a Personal Assistant application. This will be a chatbot where the user can upload a pdf document and then ask questions about this document to the chatbot.
This is a RAG or Retrieval-augmented generation chatbot.

Please build it with the following stack:

* python
* gradio for the chatbot interface and uploading files
* langchain if needed for connecting the documents, prompts and responses
* chroma for vectorizing and storing the uploaded files
* ollama for running the LLM. Assume ollama is already installed. Include installation instructions in the readme
* list the available models from ollama list so the user can select it's prefered model

Please provide documentation for the app on how it is build, how to install it and how to use it in the readme.

Develop this app like you are an experienced senior python and AI developer.
