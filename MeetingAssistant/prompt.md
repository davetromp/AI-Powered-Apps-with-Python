# meeting assistant
Create a meeting assistant that can record a meeting or upload an audio file of a meeting, will transcibe and then summarize.

Build this using the following stack:
* python
* gradio for user interface
* whisper for transcibing of the audio to text
* ollama running model gemma3:latest for summarization. Ollama is already installed, running and has the model downloaded

Please create this application like you are a senior python AI developer.
